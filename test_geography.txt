Geography is the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of Earth. It is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities.

Key concepts in geography include:
- Physical geography: Study of Earth's physical features like mountains, rivers, and climate
- Human geography: Study of human populations, cultures, and their interactions with the environment
- Cartography: The science and art of map-making
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Computer systems for capturing and analyzing geographic data

Important geographic features:
- The Amazon River is the largest river by discharge volume
- Mount Everest is the highest peak above sea level
- The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean
- The Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert in the world

Geography helps us understand spatial relationships and how different places are connected through trade, migration, and environmental processes.
